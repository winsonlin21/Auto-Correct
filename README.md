# Auto-Correct

**Auto-Correct** is a simple Python project that automatically corrects spelling errors from a text file input.

## How it works
- Reads from a text file (`input.txt`)
- Applies basic spell correction
- Outputs the corrected text to `output.txt`

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory using cd:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/project
   ```
4. Add the text you want to correct to the `input.txt` file.
5. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
6. The corrected version will be saved to `output.txt`.
